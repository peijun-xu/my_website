    I am currently a Masters in Analytics and Management student at London Business School, and received my Bachelor of Economics degree at Zhejiang University in July 2020, majoring in Finance. The movie "The Big Short" piqued my interest in combining analytics with business. In the movie, the hedge fund manager Michael Burry earns $2.3 billion by shorting mortgage bonds. The secret of his success was going through thousands of pages of raw mortgage data that no one else read; he was the first man to bet against the housing market. This inspired me to discover what else data analytics could achieve in financial services industry."""
