# Introduction

Copenhagen, the happiest city in the world, Who doesn't want to go there! Happiness comes at a price though, you'll need to find a place to stay. What better way to look for a place to stay than on AirBnB and us being students, would like to know what this will cost us. This is where the MAM program from LBS is already paying itself off. To do so, an exploratory data analysis is conducted. The first steps are to look at the raw values and to clean the data afterwards. This gives a foundation to use in summary statistics. Finally, visualisations will give an impression of any correlations in variables and will give an outlook on variables that stand out.

The data we will be using for this comes directly from AirBnB. In this analysis we will only be using data on the city of Copenhagen. the data shows the listings as per June 26th 2020.

The following variables will be of importance throughout this analysis:

1.    price : cost per night

1.    cleaning_fee: cleaning fee

1.    extra_people: charge for having more than 1 person

1.    property_type: type of accommodation (House, Apartment, etc.)

1.    room_type:
      Entire home/apt (guests have entire place to themselves)
      Private room (Guests have private room to sleep, all other rooms shared)
      Shared room (Guests sleep in room shared with others)
      number_of_reviews: Total number of reviews for the listing

1.    review_scores_rating: Average review score (0 - 100)

1.    longitude , latitude: geographical coordinates to help us locate the listing

1.    neighborhood*: three variables on a few major neighborhoods in each city


# Computing summary statistics of the variables of interest

In this section we will clean the data and run summary statistics that will be visualised in the next section. First the values stored as characters are converted to numeric values and the $-sign removed.

```{r cleaning data stored as character, message=FALSE}

# Make price into a numeric variable
listings$price = as.numeric(gsub("[\\$,]", "", listings$price)) 

# Make cleaning fee into a numeric variable
listings$cleaning_fee = as.numeric(gsub("[\\$,]", "", listings$cleaning_fee)) 

# Make extra people a numeric variable
listings$extra_people = as.numeric(gsub("[\\$,]", "", listings$extra_people))

```

Following this, the NA's in the cleaning_fee values will be converted to zero. Assuming the NA's are from hosts not providing an input for cleaning fees, the NA's should equal zero.

```{r cleaning data by reducing the NA, message=FALSE}

# Change NA cleaning fee values to 0, assuming that 0 is meant for NA
listings <- listings %>%   
  mutate(cleaning_fee = case_when(
    is.na(cleaning_fee) ~ 0, 
    TRUE ~ cleaning_fee
  ))

```

The property type categorical variables has too many categories to be summarised. To reduce this, the 4 most substantial categories have been specified, the remainder will be classed as other.

```{r cleaning data by reducing property type criteria, message=FALSE}

# Create a list of property types and the count
kbl(listings %>% 
  group_by(property_type) %>%
  summarise(count= n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(count))) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options=c("striped","hover","condensed","responsive"))

# Take top 4 property_type and create a new column and assigning property_type in groups
listings <- listings %>%
  mutate(prop_type_simplified = case_when(
  property_type %in% c("Apartment","Condominium", "House","Townhouse") ~ property_type, 
  TRUE ~ "Other"
  ))

```

The majority of listings are within the 1 to 4 minimum days stay. Therefore this will give a good indication of the listings intended for short, holiday, stays. In the next section the data is filtered to only feature a minimum of 4 nights or less. Also, the variables that will be used in the analysis are selected, so to only have relevant variables left to make the analysis more concise and clear.

```{r filtering, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Filter the AirBnB data so that it only includes observations less than or equal to 4
listings_filtered_4nights <- listings %>%
  filter(minimum_nights <= 4)

# Select the variables that will be used in the analysis as to remove the redundant variables
listings_clean <- listings %>%
  select(id, 
         listing_url, 
         price, 
         guests_included, 
         cleaning_fee, 
         extra_people, 
         prop_type_simplified, 
         number_of_reviews, 
         review_scores_rating, 
         room_type, 
         bathrooms, 
         bedrooms, 
         beds, 
         accommodates, 
         host_is_superhost, 
         is_location_exact, 
         neighbourhood_cleansed, 
         cancellation_policy, 
         longitude, 
         latitude
        )

```


# Visualisations

Now that the data is clean, a selection of useful data has been made, and filtered to only feature our criteria for a short stay holiday listing, visualisations of data can be made. This lays the foundation of any correlations and questions the regression model will have to explain and answer.

## location

In order to get an idea on the concentration of apartment listings in the area of Copenhagen, we plotted a map showing the number of flat available for rent for 4 nights or less. We used clusters instead of point to make the map more readable and to get a better idea of the number of listings in each area.

```{r mapping clusters, message=FALSE}

# Take the filtered listings with a min of 4 nights and create a map of the apartments in Copenhagen
listings_filtered_4nights %>% 
  leaflet() %>% 
  addProviderTiles("OpenStreetMap.Mapnik") %>% 
  addCircleMarkers(lng = ~longitude, 
                   lat = ~latitude, 
                   radius = 1,
                   fillOpacity = 0.4, 
                   popup = ~listing_url,
                   label = ~property_type,
                   #To get a better overview of the number and location of apartments in Copenhagen, a clustered map was chosen instead of the original point mapping
                   clusterOptions = markerClusterOptions()
                   )
  
```

The map shows the number of available flats are located in the city center. The more we get away from the center the fewer the number of flats available.

To gauge the price difference in each area in Copenhagen, we plotted a heatmap showing the more expensive areas in a brighter red colour. Also we plotted a bar chart to get an idea of the median price for each area. The reason for using median over mean is because the listings in Copenhagen have very extreme values and they skew the mean too much for certain areas.

```{r heatmap of price, message=FALSE}
#maps price to seven colors using quantiles
qpal <- colorQuantile("Reds", listings_filtered_4nights$price, n = 7)

listings_filtered_4nights %>% 
leaflet() %>% 
  addProviderTiles("OpenStreetMap.Mapnik") %>% 
  addCircleMarkers(lng = ~longitude, 
                   lat = ~latitude, 
                   radius = 1,
                   fillOpacity = 0.4, 
                   popup = ~listing_url,
                   label = ~property_type,
                   color = ~qpal(price))
```

We can conclude that the harbour area in Copehagen has the most expensive listings. Therefore we suspect that location will have a high coefficient when we will be running te regression models.


```{r neighborhood bar chart, message = FALSE}

#Calculated median price per night for each neighborhood
median_per_neighborhood <- listings_filtered_4nights %>% 
  group_by(neighbourhood_cleansed) %>% 
  summarise(median_price = median(price))
#Price per night for each neighborhood
median_per_neighborhood %>% 
  ggplot(aes(
    x = reorder(neighbourhood_cleansed, median_price),
    y = median_price
  )) +
    geom_col(fill = "#FF5A5F") +
  scale_fill_manual(values="#FF5A5F")+
  labs(
    title = "Median price per night per neighborhood",
    x = "",
    y = "Median price per neighborhood",
    caption = "Source: Airbnb"
  ) +
  coord_flip() +
  theme_classic() +
  NULL

```

The Indre By area in Copenhagen is the central harbour area and is the most expensive area for AirBnB prices. This confirms that the neighborhood variable will have a significant impact on the price variable.
